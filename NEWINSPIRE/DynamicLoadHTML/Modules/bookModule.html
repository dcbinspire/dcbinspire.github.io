					<h3>BOOK OF THE WEEK: Quantum</h3>
					<em><p>Category: Physics</p></em>
					For most people, quantum theory is synonymous with mysterious, impenetrable science. And in fact for many years it was equally baffling for scientists themselves. In this tour de force of science history, Manjit Kumar gives a dramatic and superbly written account of this fundamental scientific revolution

					<h3>BOOK OF THE WEEK: The Universe In Zero Words</h3>
					<em><p>Category: Mathematics</p></em>
					The Universe in Zero Words tells the history of twenty-four great and beautiful equations that have shaped mathematics, science, and society--from the elementary (1+1=2) to the sophisticated (the Black-Scholes formula for financial derivatives), and from the famous (E=mc<sup>2</sup>) to the arcane (Hamilton's quaternion equations).

					<h3>BOOK OF THE WEEK: Fermats Last Theorem</h3>
					<em><p>Category: Mathematics</p></em>
					French mathematician sets problem and then solves problem. Jots down in the margin of a book that he has a proof, but can’t be bothered to write down the proof itself. Frenchman dies, son discovers marginal note, publishes it, and the rest of the world starts trying to figure out the proof of Fermat’s Last Theorem. Everyone fails, until a ten year old boy starts working on the problem in 1963. Roughly thirty years later he comes up with a proof, but he’s made a mistake, Damn! He’s embarrassed and humiliated, but undaunted he sets down to work again and …

					<h3>BOOK OF THE WEEK: Prime Obsession</h3>
					<em><p>Category: Mathematics</p></em>
					Prime Obsession has an ambitious goal of both introducing the reader to the Riemann Hypothesis, while providing a history of Bernhard Riemann and the people influenced by his remarkably Hypothesis. As the opening chapter of the book, Chapter 1 serves as an introduction to some of the mathematical ideas that will be important to understanding later topics. More specifically, it deals with infinite series, a critical component of thesubfield of mathematics known as analysis.
