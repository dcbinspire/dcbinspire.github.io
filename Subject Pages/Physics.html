                            <p>Gravitational (aka Weight): Massive objects are attracted to each other, makes stuff (like uncoordinated hoomans) fall.<br><br>
                                Friction: the resistance that one surface or object encounters when moving over another, like tyres on a car against the road.<br><br>
                                Drag: air resistance/water resistance in one beautiful word, like why parachutes stops stuff from going SPLAT.<br><br>
                                Upthrust: upward push of surrounding air, like in a hot air balloon.<br>
                                Magnetic: forces caused by the motion of electric charge, resulting in attractive and repulsive forces between objects, like in compass needles.<br><br>
                                Electrostatic: force produced by movement of charged particles (electrons).<br><br>
                                Nuclear force: forces acting inside the nucleus of atoms, that hold that nucleons together.</p><br>

                            <h3><b>1.17 Describe the forces acting on falling objects and explain why falling objects reach a terminal velocity</b></h3>
                            <p>Weight is constant, and a force. At first, weight is larger than air resistance/drag. As the object falls, drag increases (since it is proportional to speed), reducing the resultant force. Eventually, the drag force will be equal and opposite to the weight, making the resultant force 0. According to Newton's First Law of Motion, an object moving at a constant velocity will continue to move at that velocity unless an external force is applied, and since the resultant force is 0, the velocity will be constant. At this point, the object has reached terminal velocity.</p><br>
                            
                            <h3><b>1.18 Describe experiments to investigate the forces acting on falling objects, such as sycamore seeds or parachutes</b></h3>
                            <p>Sycamore Seeds: <br><br>
                                <br> - Obtain at least 5 differently sized sycamore seeds
                                Measure the length and width with a ruler
                                <br> - Multiply to find the surface area
                                <br> - Drop the seeds one at a time, using a stopwatch to time them
                                <br> - Plot a graph of surface area vs time graph
                                Line of best fit should show that the larger the surface area, the longer the time it takes to fall
                                <br> - With smaller surface areas, there is less drag, so it is mostly weight that acts on the seed
                                <br> - We can show that drag acts on the seed by increasing the surface area 
                                <br> - Parachutes are the same just replace sycamore seeds with parachutes</p><br>
                            
                            <h3><br><b>1.19 Describe the factors affecting vehicle stopping distance including speed, mass, road condition and reaction time</b></h3>
                            <p>Stopping distance = thinking distance + braking distance
                                <br>Speed: high speed increases thinking distance and braking distance
                               <br>Mass: larger mass increases braking distance
                               <br>Road condition: slippery roads increases braking distance.
                               <br>Reaction time: slower reaction time increases thinking distance</p><br>

                                - Slows down collision, decreasing velocity, hence decreasing rate of change of momentum, reducing force

                            <h3><b>1.23 Use the relationship between force, change in momentum and time taken</b></h3>
                            <p>Force = change in momentum ÷ time taken <br><br>
                            This can be understood since the unit of force is m / s<sup>2</sup> and the units of momentum is m / s and the unit of time is s, therefore m / s<sup>2</sup> = m / s / s</p><br>
