                            <h3>1.3 explain the changes in arrangement, movement and energy of particles</h3>
                                <p>In a solid, there are strong forces of attraction between the particles, meaning that they are arranged in an ordered manner. Particles cannot move around and have a definite shape and volume that cannot be compressed. However, unless the substance is cooled to absolute zero, the particles will be vibrating in their spots. As the temperature increases, the kinetic energy the particles have increases, hence the particles start vibrating faster. <br><br>

                                When the melting point is reached, particles have enough kinetic energy to move around, and the forces of attraction between the particles are weaker (than in solids). Particles are still held closely together, but can move around to take the shape of the container. Even so, it has a fixed volume and is difficult to compress.<br><br>

                                Once the boiling point is reached, particles overcome forces of attraction. This means that particles are far apart and move quickly (due to the high kinetic energy), taking the shape of the container. Since the particles are so far apart, they have a low density and have no definite shape or volume.</p><br>
                            
                            <h3><b>1.4 describe and explain experiments to investigate the small size of particles and their movement including:</b></h3>
                                <p>i. Dilution of coloured solutions<br>
                                    Dissolve some potassium manganate in 10cm3 of water in a test tube - A purple solution should form.
                                    Add 1ml of the solution to another 10ml of water and repeat until no colour can be seen.<br><br>

                                    As the solution becomes diluted, the particles become further apart. This shows that the particles must be very small as it takes many tries for no colour to be seen.<br><br>

                                    ii. Diffusion experiments<br>
                                    IN GAS:<br>
                                    Place 2 cotton wool (one dipped in Ammonia and the other in Hydrochloric acid) on opposite ends of a gas tube. A white ring (ammonium chloride) should form towards the end with the HCl because ammonia is less dense and travels faster through the air.<br><br>

                                    IN LIQUIDS: <br>
                                    Place a crystal of potassium permangenate in the water. The coloured particles split off from the crystal and move through the solution until it is evenly spread out. This turns the solution from colourless to purple.</p><br>
                            
                            <h3>1.5 understand the terms atom and molecule</h3>

                            <h3>1.6 understand the differences between elements, compounds and mixtures</h3>
                                <p>Element: A substance that cannot be broken down by chemical means. <br>
                                Compound: Two or more elements chemically combined, to which they are not all the same. <br>
                                Mixture: Two or more substances that are not chemically combined.</p><br>
                            
                            <h3>1.7 describe experimental techniques for the separation of mixtures, including simple distillation, fractional distillation, filtration, crystallization and paper chromatography.</h3>
                                <p>Simple distillation: One substance is evaporated off, to either obtain the substance or the substance dissolved in it. E.g. Obtaining salt from water.<br><br>
                                    Fractional distillation: Different substances have different boiling points, therefore, condense at difference parts of the boiling tube and collected separately. This works because temperatures get cooler the higher up the tube you go.<br><br>
                                    Filtration: When a mixture is poured through filter paper inside a funnel to separate the insoluble substance (residue) from the soluble substance (filtrate). E.g. sand for water <br><br>
                                    Crystallization: A solution is heated with an evaporation dish and bunsen burner, however, not fully, once most of the water has boiled away, the dish should be left to cool and evaporate so crystals will form. <br><br>
                                    Chromatography: Colours like inks and dyes are placed on a chromatography paper and into a solvent. The colours are then separated as the solvent travels up the paper.
                                </p><br>
                            
                            <h3>1.8 explain how information from chromatograms can be used to identify the composition of a mixture</h3>
                                <p>1. Using a pencil, draw a line 2cm parallel to the bottom of the paper.<br>
                                    2. Draw dots 0.5cm in diameter for the mixtures, ensuring that they are spaced 1cm apart.<br>
                                    3. Fill 1cm in height of a beaker with water.<br>
                                    4. Place the chromatography paper into the water, ensuring that the water is below the pencil line.<br>
                                    5. Hold the paper in this position until the water level rises above the dyes, and the dyes stop separating.<br>
                                    6. Take the paper out of the beaker of water, and allow to dry.<br>
                                    7. Compare the distance travelled of the dyes (R<sub>f</sub> values) with known dyes.</p><br>

                            <h3>1.12 calculate the relative atomic mass of an element from the relative abundances of its isotopes</h3>
                                <p>Relative atomic mass is the average weight of an atom of an element.

                                <p>Metallic bonding is sometimes described as an array of positive ions in a 'sea of electrons'. The more outer electrons an atom has to delocalise, the stronger the attraction between the negative 'sea' and the higher charged ions, so the bonding is stronger and the melting point is greater.<br><br>

                                Conductivity: metals are conductive because the delocalised electrons are free to move throughout the structure when a voltage is applied.<br><br>

                                Malleability: metals are arranged in layers/sheets/rows and thus the positive ions can slide over each other into new positions without breaking the metallic bonds because they are always surrounded by a sea of electrons, meaning they are malleable.</p><br>

                            <p>***<u>Underlined</u> points are triple***</p><br>
                            <h3>2.1 understand the terms group and period</h3>
                                <p>Group = column<br>Period = row</p><br>
                            <h3>2.2 recall the positions of metals and non-metals in the Periodic Table </h3>
                                <p>Non metals are positioned to the right of Boron, Silicon etc in a zigzag pattern.</p><br>
                            <h3>2.3 explain the classification of elements as metals or non-metals on the basics of their electrical conductivity and the acid-base character of their oxides </h3>
                                <p>Metals are conductive, and their oxides are alkali. Non-metals are less conductive, and their oxides are acidic.</p><br>
                            <h3>2.4 understand why elements in the same group of the Periodic Table habve similar chemical properties </h3>
                                <p>Elements in the same group have same numbers of electrons in the outer shell, which means they react with other elemants in similar ways.</p><br>
                            <h3>2.5 understand that the noble gases (Group 0) are a family of inert gases and explain their lack of reactivity in terms of their electronic configurations. </h3>
                                <p>Nobel gases have a full outer shell, which means they are relatively stable</p><br>
                            <h3>2.6 describe the reactions of Group 1 elements with water and understand that the reactions provide a basis for their recognition as a family of elements </h3>
                                <p>Lithium: effervescence<br>Sodium: effervescence<br>Potassium: melts into a sphere and whizzes around the surface of the water with a lilca flame</p><br>
                            <h3>2.7 describe the relative reactivities of the elements in Group 1 </h3>
                                <p>The further down you move in Group 1, the more reactive the elements are</p><br>
                            <h3>2.8 <u>explain the relative reactivities of the elements in Group 1 in terms of distance between the outer electrons and the nucleus</u> </h3>
                                <p>As you move down the periods, the elements get more reactive. This is because tehre are more inner shells, increasing the distance between the nucleus and the outer electrons. The shells in between give the electron shielding from the positive nucleus, weakening the electrostatic attraction between the negative electron and the nucleus. Therefore, the outer electron is lost more easily, making the element more reactive</p><br>
                            <h3>2.9 recall the colours and physical states of halogens at room temperature</h3>
                                <p>Flourine - yellow gas<br>Chlorine - green gas<br>Bromine - dark red/brown liquid/gas<br> Iodine- dark grey/purple solid/gas</p><br>
                            <h3>2.10 make predictions about the properties of other halogens in this group</h3>
                                <p>Astatine - black solid</p><br>
                            <h3>2.11 understand the difference between hydrogen chloride gas and hydrochloric acid</h3>
                                <p>HCl (g): simple (polar) covalent compound, no ions.<br>HCl (aq): ions (H<super>+</super>,Cl<super>-</super>) dissociated in water</p><br>
                            <h3>2.12 explain, in terms of dissociation, why hydrogen chloride is acidic in water but not in methylbenzene</h3>
                                <p>Water, which is polar, dissociates hydrogen chloride into H<super>+</super> and Cl<super>-</super> ions when it dissolves. The hydrogen ions make the solution acidic. Methylbenzene, on the other hand, is non-polar. This means it does not dissociate hydrogen chloride and therefore does not produce acidic hydrogen ions.</p><br>
                            <h3>2.13 describe the relative reactivites of the elements in Group 7</h3>
                                <p>As you move down Group 7, the elements get less reactive</p><br>
                            <h3>2.14 describe experiments to demonstrate that a more reactive halogen will displace a less reactive halogen from a solution of one of its salts </h3>
                                <p>Take a dimple tray and put spots of halides in each dimple using a pipette.<br>Use a pipette and place 3 drops of a halogen into those dimples, mixing them with the halide.<br>If a colour change is observed, the halogen in the halide has been displaced.</p><br>
                            <h3>2.15 understand these displacement reactions as redox reactions</h3>
                                <p>The halogen is reduced, since it gains electrons<br>The halide is oxidised, since it loses electrons</p><br>
                            <h3>2.16 recall the gases present in air and their approximate percentage by volume</h3>
                                <p>Nitrogen = 78.1%<br>Oxygen = 21.0%<br>Argon = 0.9%<br>Carbon Dioxide = 0.04%</p><br>
                            <h3>2.17 explain how experiments involving the reactions of elements such as copper, iron and phosphorus with air can be used to investigate the percentage by volume of oxygen in air</h3>
                                <p>Using Copper<br>- The apparatus originally contains 100cm<super>3</super> of air<br>- This is pushed backwards and forwards over the heated copper, which turns black as copper(II) oxide is formed<br>- The volume of gas in the syringes falls as the oxygen is used up<br>- As the copper reacts, the Bunsen burner is moved along the tubes so that it is always heating fresh copper<br>- Eventually, all the oxygen in the air is used up<br>- The volume stops dropping as the copper stops reacting due to the lack of oxygen<br>- After cooling, roughly 79cm<super>3</super> of gas is left in the syringes. Thus, we can see that 21% of the initial volume has been used up, allowing us to deduce that the air contained 21% oxygen.<br>Using Iron<br>- A tube containing damp iron wool or iron filings in a test tube containing air is inverted in a beaker of water.<br>- The water level in the tube is marked by a small elastic band.<br>- The tube is left for a week or so for the iron to use up all the oxygen.<br>- The water level rises in the tube as the oxygen is used up.<br>- The new level is marked with a second rubber band.<br>- The volume of the gas used up is found by filling the tube with water to each of the rubber bands in turn and pouring it into a small measuring cylinder.<br>- Subtract the final volume from the initial volume to find the volume of gas used.<br>- Divide volume of gas used by total volume of gas to find percentage of oxygen.</p><br>
                            <h3>2.18 describe the laboratory preparation of oxygen from hydrogen peroxide, using manganese(IV) oxide as a catalyst </h3>
                                <p>Set up a sdie-arm boiling tube with hydrogen peroxide solution and solid manganese(IV) oxide.<br>- Use a thistle funnel to add more hydrogen peroxide if necessary.<br>- Connect side arm boiling tube to a delivery tube that delivers the oxygen produced into a test tube inverted in a beaker of water.</p><br>
                            <h3>2.19 describe the reactions of magnesium, carbon and sulfur with oxygen in air, and the acid-base character of the oxides produced</h3>
                                <p>Magnesium<br>- Bright white flame<br>- Forms white, powdery ash of magnesium oxide<br>- Metal oxides are bases.<br>Sulphur<br>- Burns in a tiny, almost invisible, blue flame<br>- Poisonous, colourless, and acidic sulphur dioxide is produced.<br>Carbon Dioxide<br>- Carbon burns if heated very strongly in air<br>- Produces colourless CO<sub>2</sub><br>- May produce small yellow-orange flame and perhaps some sparks</p><br>
                            <h3>2.20 describe the laboratory preparation of carbon dioxide from calcium carbonate and dilute hydrochloric acid</h3>
                                <p>Same as with oxygen except for the use of calcium carbonate (in the form of marble chips) and dilute hydrochloric acid</p><br>
                            <h3>2.21 cescribe the formation of carbon dioxide from the thermal decomposition of metal carbonates such as copper(II) carbonate</h3>
                                <p>Metal carbonate -> Carbon dioxide + metal oxide</p><br>
                            <h3>2.22 describe the properties of carbon dioxide, limited to its solubility and density </h3>
                                <p>Carbon dioxide is soluble in water, and forms carbonic acid.<br>Carbon dioxide is not dense as it is a gas. However, it is much denser than air; it sinks in air.</p><br>
                            <h3>2.23 explain the use of carbon dioxide in carbonating drinks and in fire extinguishers, in terms fo its solubility and density</h3>
                                <p>Carbonating drinks: Carbon dioxide is slightly soluble in water. Under pressure, it will dissolve. When the pressure is released, the carbon dioxide is less solube and thus escapes, creating bubbles in the drink.<br>Fire extinguishers: Carbon dioxide is denser than oxygen and therefore displaces it in a fire, smothering the flame.</p><br>
                            <h3>2.24 understand that carbondioxide is a greenhouse gas and may contribute to climate change</h3>
                                <p>The Sun radiates energy to the Earth<br>The Earth re-emits some energy as infrared radiation<br>Greenhouse gases absorb these infrared rays, and therefore less energy is released into space, warming the atmosphere.</p><br>
                            <h3>2.25 describe the reactions of dilute hydrochloric and dilute sulfuric acids with magnesium, aluminium, zinc and iron</h3>
                                <p>Magnesium<br>- Effervescence<br>- Magnesium decreases in size<br>- Solution heats up (exothermic reaction)<br>- Colourless solution<br>Aluminium<br>- Slow reaction<br>- When heated, reaction speeds up, causing effervescence<br>- Aluminium decreases in size<br>- Colourless solution<br>Zinc<br>- Effervescence<br>- Zinc decreases in size<br>- Solution heats up (exothermic reaction)<br>- Colourless solution<br>Iron(II)<br>- Effervescence<br>- Iron decreases in size<br>- Solution heats up (exothermic reaction)<br>- Pale green solution</p><br>

                            <h3>2.27 describe the use of anhydrous copper(II) sulfate in the chemical test for water</h3>
                                <p>The copper(II) sulfate is hydrated by the water, causing it to change in colour from white to blue</p><br>
                            <h3>2.28 describe a physical test to show whether water is pure</h3>

                            <h3>2.30 describe how reactions with water and dilute acids can be used to deduce the reactivites of metals and their compounds</h3>
                                <p>1. React all metals with water<br>2. Obeserve reactions. More bubbles and fizzing = more reactive.<br>3. React metals that do not react with water with acid<br>4. Observe reactions. More bubbles and fizzing = more reactive.<br>5. Place in order of most effervescence. Metals that react with water are more reactive than metals that do not.</p><br>
                            <h3>2.31 deduce the position of a metal within the reactivity series using displacement reactions between metals and their oxides, and between metals and their salts in aqueous solutions</h3>
                                <p>A more reactive metal will displace a less reactive metal</p><br>
                            <h3>2.32 understand oxidation and reduction as the addition and removal of oxygen respectively</h3>
                                <p>But also loss and gain of electrons. Look at the question to determine which definition to use. Or just go with both where applicable</p><br>
                            <h3>2.33 understand the terms redox, oxidising agent, and reducing agent</h3>
                                <p>Redox: a reaction where one substance is reduced and another is oxidised simultaneously<br>Oxidising agent: a substance that causes oxidation by being reduced and gaining electrons<br>Reducing agent: a substance that causes reduction by being oxidised and losing electrons.</p><br>
                            <h3>2.34 describe the conditions under which iron rusts</h3>
                                <p>For rusting to occur, water and oxygen must be present</p><br>
                            <h3>2.35 describe how the rusting of iron may be prevented by grease, oil, paint, plastic and galvanising</h3>
                                <p>Coating iron in grease, oil, paint or plastic prevents rusting by isolating the iron; the iron cannot rust due to the lack of oxygen and water.<br>Galvanising iron prevents rusting since zinc is more reactive than iron. The zinc acts as a reducing agent, preventing the oxidation of iron.</p><br>
                            <h3>2.36 understand the sacrifical protection of iron in terms of the reactivity series</h3>

        <h3><b>4.15 understand that the breaking of bonds is endothermic and that the making of bonds is exothermic</b></h3>
        <br>
        
        <h3><b><u>4.16 use average bond energies to calculate the enthalpy change during a simple chemical reaction.</u></b></h3>

        <p>Count and compare bubbles per minute OR the volume of gas produced in one minute (use a gas syringe and stopwatch) OR the time taken for a fixed volume of gas to be created (use a gas syringe and stopwatch).</p>
        <br>
        
        <h3><b>4.18 describe the effects of changes in surface area of a solid, concentration of solutions, pressure of gases, temperature and the use of a catalyst on the rate of a reaction</b></h3>
        <p>SURFACE AREA: when surface area increases, rate of reaction increases because the frequency of collision increases.<br>CONCENTRATION OF SOLUTIONS: when the concentration of solutions increases, the frequency of collisions increases, hence increasing the rate of reaction.<br>PRESSURE OF GASES: when the pressure of gases increases, the frequency of collisions between gas molecules increases, hence increasing the rate of reaction.<br>TEMPERATURE: when the temperature increases, the particles have a higher average kinetic energy, leading to an increase in the frequency of collisions. The increased kinetic energy also means that the activation energy of the reactions is met more easily, increasing the frequency of successful collisions thus resulting in a higher rate of reaction.<br>CATALYST: creates an alternate pathway with activation energy, but remains chemically unchanged at the end of the reaction.</p>
        <br>
        
        <h3><b>4.19 understand the term activation energy and represent it on a reaction profile</b></h3>
        <br>
        
        <h3><b>4.20 explain the effects of changes in surface area of a solid, concentration of solutions, pressure of gases and temperature on the rate of a reaction in terms of particle collision theory</b></h3>
        <p><i>Surface area:</i> more area on solid for acid particles to collide into. Therefore, frequency of collision increases &#8594; higher rate of reaction<br><i>Concentration of solutions:</i> increasing the concentration will increase the number of times the particles collide &#8594; higher rate of reaction.<br><i>Pressure of gases:</i> Increasing the pressure of gases means the particles are closer together so they hit each other more frequently &#8594; higher rate of reaction<br><i>Temperature:</i> the higher the temperature, the faster the rate of reaction. This is because with higher temperature, the particles are moving faster and colliding more often. Furthermore, all reactions have an activation energy, meaning not all collisions will end with a reaction. With more heat energy, particles will collide with more energy and therefore the rate of reaction will increase.</p>
        <br>
        
        <h3><b>4.21 explain that a catalyst speeds up a reaction by providing an alternative pathway with lower activation energy.</b></h3>
        <p>Catalysts are substances that speed up a chemical reaction by providing an alternate pathway with lower activation energy. They remain chemically unchanged at the end of the reaction.</p>
        <br>
        
        <h3><b>4.22 understand that some reactions are reversible and are indicated by the symbol ⇌􏰁 in equations</b></h3>
        <br>
        
        <h3><b>4.23 describe reversible reactions such as the dehydration of hydrated copper(II) sulfate and the effect of heat on ammonium chloride</b></h3>
        <p>Dehydration of hydrated copper(II) sulfate is an endothermic reaction. It happens when you remove the water.<br>Heating ammonium chloride gives you ammonia and hydrogen chloride.</p>
        <br>
        
        <h3><b>4.24 understand the concept of dynamic equilibrium</b></h3>
        <p>When a the rate of the forward reaction = rate of the backward reaction in a reversible reaction. The concentration of the reactants and the concentration of the products are constant (not necessarily equal). The forward and backward reaction happen simultaneously.</p>

                            <h3>5.1 explain how the methods of extraction of the metals in this section are related to their positions in the reactivity series</h3>
        <p>EXTRACTION OF IRON: <br>- A blast furnace is used since carbon is more reactive (higher up in the reactivity series) than iron.<br><br>EXTRACTION OF ALUMINIUM:<br>- Aluminium is more reactive than carbon so it cannot be displaced<br>- Thus, it must be obtained by electrolysis.</p>
        <br>

        <p>The use of molten cryolite as a solvent and to decrease the required operating temperature <br>- Cryolite has a lower melting point therefore the required operating temperature is reduced.<br>- This means that operating cost is also reduced.<br><br>The need to replace the positive electrodes <br>- Oxygen produced at the positive electrode (anode) reacts with the electrode itself, which is made of carbon, to form CO<sub>2</sub><br>- This means that the mass of the electrode decreases over time (the electrode gets smaller)<br>- Thus, they must be replaced<br><br>The cost of the electricity as a major factor</p>
        <br>
        
        <h3>5.3 write ionic half-equations for the reactions at the electrodes in aluminium extraction</h3>

        <br>
        
        <h3>5.7 describe and explain how the industrial process of fractional distillation separates crude oil into fractions</h3>
        <p>1. Crude oil is heated at the bottom of the fractionating column.<br>2. Hydrocarbons vaporise, and start to rise up the fractionating column.<br>3. The top of the column is cooler, the bottom hotter.<br>4. Since larger hydrocarbons have higher boiling points, they condense in the lower fractions.<br>5. Smaller hydrocarbons continue to rise, and condense in the higher fractions.</p>
        <br>
        
        <h3>5.8 recall the names and uses of the main fractions obtained from crude oil: refinery gases, gasoline, kerosene, diesel, fuel oil and bitumen</h3>

        <h3>5.13 understand that fractional distillation of crude oil produces more long-chain hydrocarbons than can be used directly and fewer short-chain hydrocarbons than required and explain why this makes cracking necessary</h3>
        <p>Smaller hydrocarbons (shorter chains) are more volatile and combustible thus more useful. This means demand for them is very high, making them more valuable. Long-chain hydrocarbons have fewer applications. Since there aren't enough short-chain hydrocarbons, cracking is necessary.</p>
        <br>
        
        <h3>5.14 describe how long-chain alkanes are converted to alkenes and shorter-chain alkanes by catalytic cracking, using silica or alumina as the catalyst and a temperature in the range of 600–700􏰅&deg;C.</h3>
        <p>Large hydrocarbon put into boiling tube with aluminium oxide catalyst/ceramic in the middle. Boiling tube is heated up, large hydrocarbon evaporates and goes through the delivery tube to be collected.<br><br>e.g. C<sub>10</sub>H<sub>22</sub> &#8594; C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>14</sub> + C<sub>4</sub>H<sub>8</sub><br><br>C-C single bonds of long-chain hydrocarbon broken.<br>C=C double bonds form.</p>

        <br>
        
        <h3>5.19 explain that addition polymers are hard to dispose of as their inertness means that they do not easily biodegrade</h3>

        <br>
        
        <h3>5.24 understand how the cooling of the reaction mixture liquefies the ammonia produced and allows the unused hydrogen and nitrogen to be recirculated</h3>
        <p>The reaction is cooled below ammonia's boiling point, but not hydrogen's and nitrogen's, so the ammonia condenses and liquefies while the unreacted hydrogen and nitrogen remain in gas state and stay in the reactor.</p>

        <p>NOTE: This will be a lot easier to understand if you look up a diagram.<br>Sodium chloride goes in from the side with the positive anode and is at a higher level so that no sodium hydroxide formed on the side of the cathode can flow backward and react with chlorine to make bleach.<br>Diaphragm is made of a porous material so the solution can seep through.</p>
        <br>
