It is generally believed that light waves only move in straight lines. However, as per the recent research in 2010 using computer controlled hologram, it has been proved that light, too, can get twisted into knots. According to the study, when light passes through the hologram, it twists into different shapes, producing multiple knots.
It is estimated that Sun burns around 620 million metric tons of hydrogen/second into 616 million metric tons of helium. Out of this total volume, around 4 million tons of mass enters the solar system. Furthermore, only about 3.6 pounds of the mass reaches our earth. Had even 1 percent of the energy produced out of fusion reached us, what would have been the scenario?
As per the recent studies and discoveries in the field of Physics, a nude human body constantly radiates around 1000 watts of heat and absorbs about 900 watts. However, once the person covers his body with clothes, the outflow of the heat flux reduces considerably due to the exterior barrier. The amount of heat outflow from the human body is more than enough in lightning up a 100 watt bulb for some time.
