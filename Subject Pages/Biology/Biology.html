                            <h3>2.9 understand how the functioning of enzymes can be affected by changes in temperature, including changes due to change in active site</h3>
                            <p>When temperature increases, the kinetic energy increases. At first, this means that the rate of reaction increases, reaching a peak at the optimum temperature. However, when the temperature increases too much, the bonds holding the enzyme together break, meaning the enzyme loses its 3D shape, altering the active site. This means that the enzyme is no longer complimentary to the substrate, meaning it can no longer function.</p><br>
            
                            <h3>2.10 <u>understand how the functioning of enzymes can be affected by changes in active site caused by changes in pH</u></h3>
                            <p>Changes in pH can break the enzyme's bonds, making it lose its 3D shape, altering its active site. This means that the enzyme is no longer complimentary to the substrate, meaning it can no longer function. Enzymes have an optimum pH where they are most effective.</p><br>
            
                            <h3>2.11 describe experiments to investigate how enzyme activity can be affected by changes in temperature.</h3>
                            <p>1. Place 3 drops of iodine solution in dimples of a spotting tile.
                                <br>2. Heat/cool equal volumes of starch suspension and amylase solution to the desired temperature in separate boiling tubes in a water/ice bath.
                                <br>3. Mix the two substances in another boiling tube in the water/ice bath, and transfer 3 drops of the mixture to the first dimple of a spotting tile.
                                <br>4. Transfer 3 drops every 30 seconds, until the iodine solution no longer turns blue-black.
                                <br>5. Record the amount of time elapsed for there to be no colour change.
                                <br>6. Repeat with desired temperatures.</p><br>

                            <p><b>Diffusion</b>: the movement of substances from an area of high concentration to an area of low concentration, down the concentration gradient.
                                <br><b>Osmosis</b>: movement of water molecules from an area of high water potential to an area of low water potential through a semi-permeable membrane.
                                <br><b>Active transport</b>: the movement of substances from an area of low concentration to an area of high concentration, against the concentration gradient, requiring energy.</p><br>
            
                            <h3>2.13 understand that movement of substances into and out of cells can be by diffusion, osmosis and active transport</h3>
                            <p></p><br>
            
                            <h3><u>2.14 understand the importance in plants of turgid cells as a means of support</u></h3>
                            <p>A turgid cell is basically a plant cell that is full of water, this increases the volume of the cytoplasm which exerts pressure outwards. This makes the cells stronger so they can support the plant, this also helps the plant grow upwards.</p><br>
            
                            <h3>2.15 understand the factors that affect the rate of movement of substances into and out of cells, to include the effects of surface area to volume ratio, temperature and concentration gradient</h3>
                            <p><b>Higher SA : Volume ratio</b> => faster movement of substances
                                <br><b>Higher temperature</b> => faster movement of substances
                                <br><b>Steeper concentration gradient</b> => faster diffusion, slower active transport</p><br>
            
                            <h3>2.16 describe experiments to investigate diffusion and osmosis using living and non-living systems.</h3>
                            <p><b>Diffusion</b>:
                                <br>1. Add potassium permanganate to water
                                <br>2. Time how long it takes for the solution to be one colour
                                <br>3. Increase temperature as desired, observe effects

                                <br><br><b>Osmosis</b>:
                                <br>1. Place a drop of water on one microscope slide, and a drop of concentrated (Molar) sucrose solution on another
                                <br>2. Obtain two squares of the inner epidermis from an onion
                                <br>3. Transfer one square onto the slide with water, and the other to the sucrose solution
                                <br>4. Place another drop of the correct solution on the respective slides, on top of the onion sample
                                <br>5. Cover with a cover slip
                                <br>6. Observe samples under a microscope
                                <br>7. Cells in the water will remain/become turgid; cells in sucrose solution will start to plasmolyse</p><br>

                                <br>When guard cells are turgid (during the day), the stomata open. At night, the guard cells become flaccid, and so the stomata close.</p><br>

                            <br><b>Intercostal muscles</b>: when the organism inhales, the external intercostal muscles contract, internal intercostal muscles relax, decreasing pressure in the lungs, sucking air in, and pulling the ribs up and out (and vice versa).
                            <br><b>Diaphragm</b>: a shallow, dome-shaped muscular partition separating the thorax from the abdomen. Flattens when the organism inhales, and returns to its dome shape when the organism exhales.
                            <br><b>Trachea</b>: stretch from the larynx to the bronchi, reinforced by C-shaped rings of cartilage.

                            <p><b>Large surface area</b> => lots of diffusion
                                <br><b>One cell thick</b> => short diffusion distance

                                <br>- Cilia in the trachea and bronchioles damaged by tar, leading to infections (e.g. bronchitis)
                                <br>- Surface area of alveoli reduced by tar, which breaks down and fuses the walls, leading to emphysema
                                <br><br><b>Circulatory system</b>
                                <br>- Coronary arteries are among the narrowest in the body
                                <br>- Can easily be blocked by a build up for fatty substances
                                <br>- Smoking increases blood pressure and increases the chances of vessels clotting
                                <br>- If the coronary vessel clots, blood cannot reach the cardiac muscle => No glucose or oxygen for respiration, waste products cannot be removed.
                                <br>- If the cardiac muscle cannot respire, it does not have energy to contract

                            <h3>2.55 explain how the rate of transpiration is affected by changes in humidity, wind speed, temperature and light intensity</h3>
                            <p><b>Humidity</b>: increase in humidity decreases the rate of transpiration since the concentration gradient reduces.
                            <br><b>Wind speed</b>: increase in wind speed increases rate of transpiration since the concentration gradient for diffusion is maintained.
                            <br><b>Temperature</b>: increase in temperature increases the rate of transpiration since water molecules will have more kinetic energy and are more likely to escape into the atmosphere.
                                <br><b>Light intensity</b>: increase in light intensity increases the rate of transpiration since it causes the stomata to open.</p><br>

                            <br>Structure: <b>No nucleus</b> => larger surface area for oxygen; thin = short diffusion distance.

                            <br>- Prevent pathogens from dividing/reproducing
                            <br>- Clump pathogens together for phagocytes

                            <p>- Exposure to air stimulates the platelets and damaged tissue to produce a chemical that turns the soluble plasma protein fibrinogen into the insoluble protein fibrin. 
                            <br>- The fibrin forms a network which prevents further loss of blood and entry of pathogens 
                            <br>- The clot develops a scab, which protects damaged tissue while new tissue grows. </p><br>

                            <p>1. Blood enters the atria, and cannot pass into the ventricles yet because the bicuspid (mitral) and tricuspid valves are closed.
                            <br>2. Atrial systole increases the pressure in the atria, opening the valves. Blood flows from the atria into the ventricles.
                            <br>3. When the ventricles are full, ventricular systole (and atrial diastole) occurs, increasing the blood pressure in the ventricles, closing the bicuspid and tricuspid valves.
                            <br>4. Eventually the pressure forces open the semilunar valves at the base of the aorta and pulmonary artery.
                            <br>5. As the ventricles empty, high pressure in the aorta and pulmonary arteryclosethe semilunar valves in these blood vessels. The cycle begins again as the atria start to be filled with blood. </p><br>

                            <p><b>Bowman's capsule</b>: surrounds the glomerulus; cells of the Bowman's capsule help restrict which substances pass into the nephron. It is separated from the glomerulus by a basement membrane.
                            <br><b>Glomerulus</b>: ball of capillaries surrounded by the Bowman's capsule. Arterioles bring blood to the capillaries, and since capillaries are much smaller in diameter, there is high pressure on the blood in the arteriole flowing into the glomerulus, forcing fluid from the blood to flow through the capillaries and Bowman's capsule. 
                            <br><b>Convoluted tubules</b>: proximal convoluted tubule is the first coil, where all the glucose is absorbed, as well as ions like Na+ , Cl- , K+, and water; distal convoluted tubule is the second coil (after the loop of Henlé), where more water and Na+ and Cl- ions are reabsorbed.
                            <br><b>Loop of Henle</b>: more water is reabsorbed into the blood, causing the fluid in the tubule to be more concentrated.
                            <br><b>Collecting duct</b>: water is selectively reabsorbed.

                            <br><b>Cornea</b>: transparent front part of the eye that refracts light.
                            <br><b>Pupil</b>: opening in the iris that lets light through to the retina.
                            <br><b>Iris</b>: coloured muscular part of the eye that controls pupil size.
                            <br><b>Lens</b>: transparent part of the eye that focuses light.
                            <br><b>Suspensory ligaments</b>: ligament that controls the shape of the lens.

                            <br><b>Distant</b>: ciliary muscles relax, suspensory ligaments stretch, lens pulled thin and flat.
                            <br><b>Near</b>: ciliary muscles contract, suspensory ligaments slacken, lens bulges.

                            <br><br><b>Tip</b>: You know how our parents tell us to look around after staring at our screens for too long? That's so that your focus goes from something right in front of you to something far away, relaxing your eye muscles. Remember this and you'll remember which actions are associated with which muscles.

                            <br><br><b><u>Light intensity</u></b>:
                            <br><b>Bright</b>: more photoreceptors stimulated, nerve impulses sent to brain, radial muscles relax, circular muscles of the iris contract, pupil constricts, less light enters.
                            <br><b>Dark</b>: fewer photoreceptors stimulated, fewer nerve impulses sent to brain, radial muscles contract, circular muscles of the iris relax, pupil dilates, more light enters.

                            <br><br><b>Tip</b>: the circular muscles do what you'd think they do- contract to make stuff smaller. Just remember the radial muscles do the opposite and you're set :D</p><br>

                            <h3>4.4 explain the names given to different trophic levels to include producers, primary, secondary and tertiary consumers and decomposers</h3>
                            <p>PRODUCERS: plants convert light energy into chemical potential energy (autotroph)<br>PRIMARY: herbivores that eat producers (heterotroph)<br>SECONDARY: carnivores/omnivores that eat primary consumers (heterotroph)<br>TERTIARY: carnivores/omnivores that eat secondary consumers (heterotroph)<br>DECOMPOSERS: microorganisms that break down cells of dead organisms into simpler substances (saprotroph)</p>
                            <br>
                            
                            <h3>4.5 understand the concepts of food chains, food webs, pyramids of number, pyramids of biomass and pyramids of energy transfer</h3>
                            <p>FOOD CHAIN: a sequence showing feeding relationships.<br>FOOD WEB: shows how different food chains in an ecosystem relate to each other.<br>PYRAMID OF NUMBER: shows the number of organisms in each trophic level ignoring mass.<br>PYRAMID OF BIOMASS: shows the mass of the organisms in each trophic level, ignoring numbers.<br>PYRAMID OF ENERGY TRANSFER: shows the transfer of energy from each trophic level to the next.</p>
                            <br>
                            
                            <h3>4.6 understand the transfer of substances and of energy along a food chain</h3>
                            <p>When an organism uses the energy from the break down of the nutrients they obtain to produce new cells, substances and energy are stored. When the consumer on the next trophic level eats this organism, the process repeats. </p>
                            <br>
                            
                            <h3>4.7 explain why only about 10% of energy is transferred from one trophic level to the next.</h3>
                            <p>- Some of the food is not absorbed<br>- Some materials digested form excretory products (waste products of metabolism)<br>- Many materials are respired to release energy<br>- If energy from respiration is not used for producing new cells, it cannot be passed on tothe next trophic level. Once used, it will eventually escape as heat from the organism. Energy is therefore lost from the food chain. </p>
                            <br>
                            
                            <h3><u>4.8 describe the stages in the water cycle, including evaporation, transpiration, condensation and precipitation*</u></h3>
                            <p>- Heat from the sun evaporates water from the surface of oceans, lakes, and rivers.<br>- Plant transpiration and respiration release water vapour.<br>- When clouds rise over high ground, water is cooled and condenses.<br>- This precipitation falls on Earth and is used by organisms.</p>
                            <br>
                            
                            <h3>4.9 describe the stages in the carbon cycle, including respiration, photosynthesis, decomposition and combustion</h3>
                            <p>- Photosynthesis 'fixes' carbon atoms from carbon dioxide into organic compounds<br>- Feeding and assimilation pass these carbon atoms along food chains<br>- Respiration creates carbon dioxide<br>- Plants and animals die and decomposers break them down into simpler substances<br>- Some of the matter is not completely decayed, and are fossilised<br>- Combustion of fossil fuels releases carbon dioxide into the atmosphere<br>- The ocean acts as a carbon sink</p>
                            <br>
                            
                            <h3><u>4.10 describe the stages in the nitrogen cycle, including the roles of nitrogen fixing bacteria, decomposers, nitrifying bacteria and denitrifying bacteria (specific names of bacteria are not required).</u></h3>
                            <p>- Feeding and assimilation pass nitrogen atoms already in organic compounds along food chains<br>- Decomposition (putrefaction) produces ammonia<br>- Nitrogen-fixing bacteria in the soil and in legume root nodules convert nitrogen in the atmosphere into ammonia. When these bacteria die, they release the ammonia back to the soil<br>- Nitrifying bacteria oxidises ammonia first to nitrites, then to nitrates.<br>- Nitrates are absorbed and combined with carbohydrates to form amino acids then proteins, as well as other nitrogen-containing compounds in plants<br>- Denitrifying bacteria use nitrates as an energy source and convert them back into nitrogen.<br><br>NOTES: <br>- Lightning also fixes nitrogen<br>- Nitrogen is artificially fixed in the Haber process</p>
                            <br>
                            
                            <h3>4.11 understand the biological consequences of pollution of air by sulfur dioxide and by carbon monoxide</h3>
                            <p><b>Sulfur dioxide:</b> Dissolves into condensed water in clouds to cause acid rain. This pollutes rivers, kills aquatic life (including fish), damages the tops of trees, corrodes limestone structures and metalworks, etc.<br><br><b>Carbon monoxide:</b> Damages animal health, binds with haemoglobin and reduces the oxygen-carrying capacity of blood.</p>

                            <h3>4.13 understand how human activities contribute to greenhouse gases</h3>
                            <p>Agriculture: cow farts release methane<br>
                            Industry: burning fossil fuels<br>

                            <h3>4.14 understand how an increase in greenhouse gases results in an enhanced greenhouse effect and that this may lead to global warming and its consequences</h3>
                            <p><b>Process:</b><br>
                                1. Solar radiation enters Earth<br>
                                2. Some of the heat is absorbed, some is reflected
                                <br>3. Some of this reflected heat escapes into space
                                <br>4. Some heat is absorbed by the greenhouse gases and gets trapped within the Earth's atmosphere
                                <br>5. This heats up the earth
                                <br><br><b>Consequences:</b>
                                <br>- Rising sea levels
                                <br>- Change in climate
                                <br>- Increased incidence of natural disaster
                                <br>- Death of coral reefs, leading to mass extinction and more natural disasters (fun, right?)</p><br>
                            
                            <h3>4.15 <u>understand the biological consequences of pollution of water by sewage, including increases in the number of micro-organisms causing depletion of oxygen</u></h3>
                            <p>1. Microorganisms reproduce quickly<br>
                                2. They use more and more oxygen for respiration
                                <br>3. Oxygen levels are depleted
                                <br>4. Water may become totally anoxic, killing all aquatic life in that body of water</p><br>
                            
                            <h3>4.16 understand that eutrophication can result from leached minerals from fertiliser</h3>
                            <p>Primarily from nitrates and phosphates</p><br>
                            
                            <h3>4.17 understand the effects of deforestation, including leaching, soil erosion, disturbance of the water cycle and of the balance in atmospheric oxygen and carbon dioxide</h3>
                            <p><b>Leaching</b>: trees can absorb some of the nitrates and phosphates form fertilisers.
                                <br><b>Soil erosion:</b> roots hold the soil together.
                            <br><b>Disturbance of water cycle:</b> less trees = less transpiration
                            <br><b>Balance of atmospheric oxygen and carbon dioxide</b>: trees photosyntheisize, taking in carbon dioxide and releasing oxygen. </p><br>
