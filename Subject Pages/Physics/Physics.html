                            <p>Weight is constant, and a force. At first, weight is larger than air resistance/drag. As the object falls, drag increases (since it is proportional to speed), reducing the resultant force. Eventually, the drag force will be equal and opposite to the weight, making the resultant force 0. According to Newton's First Law of Motion, an object moving at a constant velocity will continue to move at that velocity unless an external force is applied, and since the resultant force is 0, the velocity will be constant. At this point, the object has reached terminal velocity.</p><br>
                            
                            <h3><b>1.18 Describe experiments to investigate the forces acting on falling objects, such as sycamore seeds or parachutes</b></h3>

                                <br> - Obtain at least 5 differently sized sycamore seeds
                                Measure the length and width with a ruler
                                <br> - Multiply to find the surface area
                                <br> - Drop the seeds one at a time, using a stopwatch to time them
                                <br> - Plot a graph of surface area vs time graph
                                Line of best fit should show that the larger the surface area, the longer the time it takes to fall
                                <br> - With smaller surface areas, there is less drag, so it is mostly weight that acts on the seed
                                <br> - We can show that drag acts on the seed by increasing the surface area 
                                <br> - Parachutes are the same just replace sycamore seeds with parachutes</p><br>

                                <br>Speed: high speed increases thinking distance and braking distance
                               <br>Mass: larger mass increases braking distance
                               <br>Road condition: slippery roads increases braking distance.
                               <br>Reaction time: slower reaction time increases thinking distance</p><br>

                            <p><b>Insulation</b>: a coating of an insulating material - usually plastic - on wires.<br>
                            <b>Double insulation</b>: coating an object in plastic so that even if the live wire touches the metal casing, it will not give the person an electric shock. Alternatively, appliances can be designed so that the live wire cannot touch the metal casing at all. The symbol for double insulation looks like 回 <br>
                            <b>Earthing</b>: when the earth wire is connected to the casing, it provides a low resistance route for electrons to travel through. As a result, instead of shocking the person, electrons travel through the earth wire and escape into the ground. The low resistance increases current (since V = IR), blowing the fuse, breaking the circuit.<br>
                            <b>Fuses</b>: when the current exceeds a certain value, it causes the wire to heat up and melt, breaking the circuit.<br>
                            <b>Circuit breakers</b>: automatically operated electrical switches that protect electrical circuits from overloading or short circuiting by detecting faults and stopping the flow of electricity when necessary- like resettable fuses.</p><br>

                            <p><b>Domestic lighting</b>: Use parallel circuits because voltage in all branches of a parallel circuit are the same; so you can control one light at a time; so if one light breaks the rest can still function. <br>
                            <b>Lawnmowers</b>: Use series circuits for safety reasons, so that both switches must be closed for lawnmower to turn on</p><br>

                            <b>Wires</b>: voltage and current are directly proportional until the wire heats up, where the graphed line will curve.<br>
                            <b>Ohmic resistors</b>: voltage and current are directly proportional until there is a large temperature increase due to the increase in current, where the resistance will increase, curving the graph.<br>
                            <b>Metal filament lamps</b>: when the filament bulb is first turned on, the resistance is quite low, so voltage and current are directly proportional. However, as the filament heats up, resistance increases, hence the graph curves<br>
                            <b>Diodes</b>: a small voltage of approximately 0.6V must be applied to the diode before it will conduct. Further increases in the voltage will increase current. If the voltage is applied in the opposite direction, almost no current flows.<br><br>

                            - In dark conditions, LDR's contain few free electrons, so they have high resistance<br>
                            - When exposed to light, more electrons are freed, so the resistance decreases<br><br>

                            4. The surplus toner is removed.<br>
                            5. Paper is pressed against the toner image to create an image on paper.<br>
                            6. The paper is heated to melt the toner image. This forms a permanent image on paper.<br><br>
                            <u><b>Inkjet printers:</b></u><br>
                            1. Each spot of ink is given a charge so that it falls between a pair of deflecting plates.<br>
                            2. Electrostatic forces direct it to the correct position.<br>
                            3. Charges on the plates change very quickly (hundreds of times per second?) so each drop falls into a different position, forming images on the paper.<br><br>
                            <u><b>Smoke precipitators:</b></u><br>
                            1. Smoke rises up the chimney and passes through a mesh of wires that are highly charged (voltage of approx. 50,000V)<br>
                            2. As they pass through the mesh, ash and dust particles become negatively charged <br>
                            3. Higher up the chimney, these particles are attracted by and stick to large earthed metal plates.<br>
                            4. "Cleaner" smoke is then released into atmosphere</p><br>
