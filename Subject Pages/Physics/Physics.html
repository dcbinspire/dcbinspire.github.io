                            <p>Weight is constant, and a force. At first, weight is larger than air resistance/drag. As the object falls, drag increases (since it is proportional to speed), reducing the resultant force. Eventually, the drag force will be equal and opposite to the weight, making the resultant force 0. According to Newton's First Law of Motion, an object moving at a constant velocity will continue to move at that velocity unless an external force is applied, and since the resultant force is 0, the velocity will be constant. At this point, the object has reached terminal velocity.</p><br>

                                <br> - Obtain at least 5 differently sized sycamore seeds
                                Measure the length and width with a ruler
                                <br> - Multiply to find the surface area
                                <br> - Drop the seeds one at a time, using a stopwatch to time them
                                <br> - Plot a graph of surface area vs time graph
                                Line of best fit should show that the larger the surface area, the longer the time it takes to fall
                                <br> - With smaller surface areas, there is less drag, so it is mostly weight that acts on the seed
                                <br> - We can show that drag acts on the seed by increasing the surface area 
                                <br> - Parachutes are the same just replace sycamore seeds with parachutes</p><br>

                                <br>Speed: high speed increases thinking distance and braking distance
                               <br>Mass: larger mass increases braking distance
                               <br>Road condition: slippery roads increases braking distance.
                               <br>Reaction time: slower reaction time increases thinking distance</p><br>

                            <p><b>Insulation</b>: a coating of an insulating material - usually plastic - on wires.<br>
                            <b>Double insulation</b>: coating an object in plastic so that even if the live wire touches the metal casing, it will not give the person an electric shock. Alternatively, appliances can be designed so that the live wire cannot touch the metal casing at all. The symbol for double insulation looks like 回 <br>
                            <b>Earthing</b>: when the earth wire is connected to the casing, it provides a low resistance route for electrons to travel through. As a result, instead of shocking the person, electrons travel through the earth wire and escape into the ground. The low resistance increases current (since V = IR), blowing the fuse, breaking the circuit.<br>
                            <b>Fuses</b>: when the current exceeds a certain value, it causes the wire to heat up and melt, breaking the circuit.<br>
                            <b>Circuit breakers</b>: automatically operated electrical switches that protect electrical circuits from overloading or short circuiting by detecting faults and stopping the flow of electricity when necessary- like resettable fuses.</p><br>

                            <p><b>Domestic lighting</b>: Use parallel circuits because voltage in all branches of a parallel circuit are the same; so you can control one light at a time; so if one light breaks the rest can still function. <br>
                            <b>Lawnmowers</b>: Use series circuits for safety reasons, so that both switches must be closed for lawnmower to turn on</p><br>

                            <b>Wires</b>: voltage and current are directly proportional until the wire heats up, where the graphed line will curve.<br>
                            <b>Ohmic resistors</b>: voltage and current are directly proportional until there is a large temperature increase due to the increase in current, where the resistance will increase, curving the graph.<br>
                            <b>Metal filament lamps</b>: when the filament bulb is first turned on, the resistance is quite low, so voltage and current are directly proportional. However, as the filament heats up, resistance increases, hence the graph curves<br>
                            <b>Diodes</b>: a small voltage of approximately 0.6V must be applied to the diode before it will conduct. Further increases in the voltage will increase current. If the voltage is applied in the opposite direction, almost no current flows.<br><br>

                            6. The paper is heated to melt the toner image. This forms a permanent image on paper.<br><br>
                            <u><b>Inkjet printers:</b></u><br>
                            1. Each spot of ink is given a charge so that it falls between a pair of deflecting plates.<br>
                            2. Electrostatic forces direct it to the correct position.<br>
                            3. Charges on the plates change very quickly (hundreds of times per second?) so each drop falls into a different position, forming images on the paper.<br><br>
                            <u><b>Smoke precipitators:</b></u><br>
                            1. Smoke rises up the chimney and passes through a mesh of wires that are highly charged (voltage of approx. 50,000V)<br>
                            2. As they pass through the mesh, ash and dust particles become negatively charged <br>
                            3. Higher up the chimney, these particles are attracted by and stick to large earthed metal plates.<br>
                            4. "Cleaner" smoke is then released into atmosphere</p><br>

                            <p>The introduction of a new magnetic field causes the overlapping of these fields.<br>- If the fields are going in the same direction, they reinforce each other, leading to a stronger field.<br>- If the fields are going in opposite directions, they 'cancel out', leading to a weaker field.<br>The stronger field lines push the particle to an area of weaker field lines (a force acts upon the charged particle) - The motor effect<br> If the particle is moving parallel to the field, no force is generated.</p>

                            <p>ELECTRIC MOTORS:<br>- There is a permanent magnetic field running parallel to the loop.<br>- When a current is passed through the loop, one side will experience an upwards force while the other side will experience a downwards force. Check the directions of the force using Fleming's Left Hand Rule.<br> - Hence, the loop will rotate.<br>- Because of the split ring, when the loop is vertical, the connections to the electric supply through the brushes swap over.<br>- The current through the loop is now in the opposite direction.<br>- Repeat.<br>- The arrangement of brushes and split ring changes the direction of the current flowing through the loop every half turn, leading to continuous rotation.<br>To increase the speed of the motor:<br>- Increase the number of loops in the wire.<br>- Increase the strength of the magnetic field.<br>- Increase the current flowing through the wire.<br> Ways in which practical motors differ from the motor described above:<br>- Permanent magnets are replaced with curved electromagnets capable of inducing very strong magnetic fields.<br>- The single loop of wire is replaced with multiple coils of wire wrapped in the same axis.<br>- The coils are wrapped on a laminated soft iron core.<br><br>LOUDSPEAKERS:<br>- Signals form a source are fed into the coil of the speaker as current which is continuously changing in size and direction.<br>- The overlapping fields of the coil and the permanent magnet create varying forces on the wires of the coil.<br>- The varying forces cause the speaker cone to vibrate.<br>- The vibrations produce longitudinal sound waves.</p>

                            <p>A voltage is induced in a conductor when the conductor cuts through magnetic field lines.<br>This can be increased by:<br>- Moving the wire more quickly.<br>- Using a stronger magnet.<br>- Using a coil with more turns.<br>- Using a coil with a larger cross-sectional area.<br> FARADAY's LAW OF ELECTROMAGNETIC INDUCTION: The size of the induced voltage across the ends of a wire (coil) is directly proportional to the rate at which the magnetic lines of flux are being cut.</p>

                            <p>- An alternating input voltage enters the primary coil.<br>- As the size of the current in the primary coil increases, the field grows.<br>- As the size of the current decreases, the field collapses.<br>- If a secondary coil is placed near the primary coil, an alternating voltage is induced across that coil due to the magnetic field cutting through the wires of the second coil.<br>- More turns = higher voltage induced; fewer turns = lower voltage induced.<br> STEP-UP TRANSFORMER: Voltage is increased. [Output Coils > Input Coils]<br> STEP-DOWN TRANSFORMER: Voltage is decreased. [Input coils > Output coils]</p>

                            <h3><b>6.18 <u>Explain the use of step-up and step-down transformers in the large-scale generation and transmission of electrical energy</u></b></h3>
                            <p>- As current passes through a wire, heat energy is lost due to resistance.<br>- Minimum current = minimum heat energy loss = maximum efficiency.<br>- Immediately after generation, electric currents from the alternators are passed through step-up transformers to decrease their current and increase their voltage. High voltage, however is dangerous, which is why wires are supported high above the ground on pylons.<br>- As the cables enter towns and cities, they are buried underground.<br>- Close to where the electrical energy is needed, the supply is passed through a step-down transformer which decreases the voltage and increases the current to useable levels.</p>
